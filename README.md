# Retrieve-materials-from-Google-Classroom
Users can access their google classroom materials uploaded by their faculties on various classroom's and retrieve them with ease.

Using this API anyone can access all their classroom that they are enrolled in and further could what all latest materials are
uploaded by various professors and TA's, moreover, if you want to download those files then you can download multiple files in
one go as compared to the original classroom where you have to open each file and then open them in the drive from there you have to 
download them. we have simplified this process to one step only also students can easily in a list format view all the materials 
if they wish to do so instead of viewing them separately which is a pain to do so.
